            <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
            <p>I'm currently supporting an initiative at <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a> to
                identify issues and unwanted changes in customer experience programs run by clients like SiriusXM,
                Southwest Airlines, and AAA. Part of this involves using existing tools querying an internal database
                via searches using SQL, and a separate tool utilizing javascript in our internal stack.</p>
            <!--<p> Moving forward,
                I'm building a new way to empower our clients to ensure the quality and timeliness of their programs with
                our amazing Engineering department. I love working with many different teams and people to construct the
                best solution for a problem. Often the best solutions are simple.</p>
            <p>Prior to working with our Engineering team, I was part of Qualtrics' Global Operations team, directly
                supporting thousands of our clients daily and leading some of our internal support teams for specific products.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I come from a background focused on solving business problems, and full stack development enables
                more targeted solutions for specific problems. Visualizing the use-case and ideal state is more critical than the
                development itself, but I love being able to contribute on a technical level, as well as the overall vision.</p>-->

            <h3>Business Communication and Organization</h3>
            <p>This is a skill that many take for granted or consider a softer skill, but for me it's been the difference
                between a great job and a smooth experience, and a frustrating job with a painful experience. All tech companies are really
                built on three pillars: Sales/Marketing, Development, and Support. When those groups don't play well together disaster strikes, so Communication
                and the ability to organize these larger groups is crucial to running a solid team.</p>
            <!--<p>I would trade a manager with flawless technical skills for one who understands the development enough to work with all teams and drive
                success for clients and product quality. Ideally a manager would be great technically and as an empath, but my point is business is run
                through people, so poor communication and messaging can sabotage your entire brand.</p>
            <p>I've been able to work cross-departmentally at Qualtrics to make sure development and messaging is consistent across teams, and that
                support processes enable better client experiences. I did this by talking with the management that ideates internal procedures, and
                building out streamlined processes of my own.</p>-->
